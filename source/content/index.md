Welcome. I'm an writer, organizer, and activist based in Portland, Maine. 

My work educates and empowers people to think critically about technology and to challenge the systems of power that benefit from the capture of our tools, our minds, and our future.

This site is the start of a project to openly share what I'm learning, communicate about my work, and practice building and using technology that reminds us of the internet days of 'yore.

If you're here and you want to get in touch about collaborating on trainings or other offerings, send me an email at leo-m-burnett@proton.me

You might be here to check out my zine "[[Clean Your Phone]]" - check it out.
