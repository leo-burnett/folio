Welcome. I'm an writer, organizer, and activist based in Portland, Maine. 

My work educates, and empowers people to think critically about technology and to challenge the systems of power that benefit from the capture of our tools, our minds, and our future.

This site is the start of a project to openly share what I'm learning, communicate about my work, and practice building and using technology that reminds us of the internet days of yore.

If you'd like to see more of the work I've done, head on over to the **portfolio** page. If you want to see more about what I'm reading, learning and following, take a look at the **reading** page (which also, by the way, includes a lot of videos, podcast, and other things not-strictly text.)
