### Organizing, Advocacy, and Capacity Building for the age of AI in Maine
 
I’m seeking to make connections with labor unions, community groups, and progressive organizing spaces to offer training, strategy, communications resources, and organizing to grow our individual and collective capacity to interrogate and limit the power of Big Tech.

Read more on [[Maine Surveillance Tech]] specific to Maine and check out my testimony and written comments page relating to the State AI Task Force Recommendations and the Portland Police's proposed drone purchase. 

#### Political organizing offerings include:

- Convening and facilitating a coalition of groups that are committed to holding technology — and especially tech bought and paid for by taxpayer dollars — accountable to the public interest.

- Education and awareness sessions for organizations on how to fight and win against the snake-oil sales pitches of an AI-enabled future.

- Creating and running a campaign for comprehensive data privacy

- Organizing and resources for local elected officials on how to critically regulate new surveillance tech.

- Cataloguing and keeping tabs on new proposals for surveillance and AI-enabled tech that’s being adopted throughout the state.

Do you know anyone who would like to fund this work? Are you a member of a group who would welcome a training or event around digital security, cleaning our phones, or understanding what AI actually is? Do you want to join a coalition to fight back against big tech in the state of Maine?
