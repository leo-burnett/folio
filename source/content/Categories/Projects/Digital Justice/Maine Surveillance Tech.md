Technology and the advancement of new tools like AI are being deployed in communities across the state at a breakneck speed. Very few guardrails exist to keep people safe from the ways this tech is currently being used — let alone the future implications of these tools. 

## Maine Surveillance Tech Watch

### Drones
- Eleven *new* law enforcement agencies in Maine have started using drones[^1] in the last year alone.

### AI Transcription Software

- Several police departments in the state are now using AI transcription software that’s described by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency) as being “intentionally designed to skirt transparency.” The software intentionally deletes drafts of AI-generated police reports, making it impossible to tell whether the final report was edited by an officer or entirely written by a large language model trained on [biased, racist data](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/11/1089683/llms-become-more-covertly-racist-with-human-intervention/).
	- This software, despite claiming to reduce report writing ["in half"](https://www.axon.com/products/draft-one) has a mixed record. The Anchorage Police Department, after testing Draft One, decided not to pursue a contract because it [didn't save time](https://alaskapublic.org/news/2024-12-04/anchorage-police-not-moving-forward-with-using-ai-to-write-reports-for-now). This is also backed up by a recent [study](https://www.crimrxiv.com/pub/nxbmzp2j/release/1) showing the same evidence. 

### Flock Cameras

- Towns like Sanford are [considering](https://sanfordspringvalenews.com/traffic-cameras-safety-tool-or-big-brother/) the installation of Flock cameras: the same company that gave [ICE agents](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/) access to a national database of AI-enabled cameras[^2]. 
- Evolving evidence is also showing that some towns and police departments — namely, South Portland and Lewiston — already have Flock cameras installed, with little to no public input on the decision. See: https://deflock.me/ and [404 Media](https://www.404media.co/tag/flock/)'s coverage of Flock cameras. 

### AI in Public Settings

- School departments and town governments are using and [deploying AI](https://themainemonitor.org/ai-maine-schools/) with little scrutiny or understanding around the false promises, inaccuracies, and biases that are built into the technology that ultimately does very few of the things it claims to be capable of doing.

[^2]: My father actually reported on this story in the next room over from me, at the same time that I was [writing](https://theburn.beehiiv.com/p/the-police-want-to-buy-a-drone-cruise-ship-pollution-and-more) about Portland’s drone purchase. The synchronicity of these two events led me to create this document.
