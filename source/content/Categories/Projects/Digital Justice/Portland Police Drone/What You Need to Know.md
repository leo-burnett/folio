## What's Happening

The Portland Police are looking for approval to buy a drone from the company Axon (see more info on Axon [[source/content/Categories/Projects/Digital Justice/Portland Police Drone/Reading|here]].)

> [!info] The drone purchase will most likely be on the next  City Council agenda on [**December 1, 2025**](https://portlandme.portal.civicclerk.com/event/8370/overview)

This approval comes as a growing number of police and sheriff's departments in Maine are purchasing new, AI-enabled surveillance tools. [[Maine Surveillance Tech|Learn more about that here.]]

## What You Need to Know

We badly need a broader discussion about police surveillance technology .
### The City Council — and the public — have no significant oversight of how and when the drone will be used.
The proposal is a **purchase order** which is accompanied by an internal police operating procedure. 
* The proposal is ***not*** an ordinance about how and when police can use drones.
* It is entirely up to the police to determine if their own procedures are being followed.
* The police's [procedure](https://portlandme.portal.civicclerk.com/event/8035/files/attachment/27615) say they will not use a drone to surveil "private citizens peacefully exercising their right to free speech and assembly" — but what is defined as "peaceful" is solely for the unelected chief of police to decide.
### The Trump administration is creating a massive surveillance program, with tech companies like Axon playing a key role in the effort. 
Many companies have already aided in this effort, especially those that host cloud services like Amazon. Some companies like **Flock** have sent data directly to ICE to aid in its deportation agenda.
* It doesn't matter that Portland technically "owns" its data when it's stored in the cloud. "Cloud companies that hold and manage your data can almost always access it, which means they can be compelled to hand it over to governments." - [*Wired Magazine*](https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/)
### We have a right to choose what kind of technology the city is buying with our tax dollars and using in our streets.
This deserves a wider conversation about surveillance in our streets — not a single yes/no vote on buying a drone.
### We have a right to privacy.
With cameras on drones, in police cruisers, and an expanding number of cameras like **Flock** being introduced, our privacy is being taken from us without our consent. 
### This kind of tech is new, and it's dangerous 
AI-enabled drones add to the growing number of surveillance devices being deployed on our streets. 
* In places where these drones have been deployed at scale, reports show that the drones are used to surveil poor, Black, and brown neighborhoods. [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-of-the-drone-police-is-here/)
### This kind of drone was tested by Israel on Palestinians
Axon partners with a company **Skydio** to make its drones.
* Skydio has extensive ties to both the Israeli government and to Israeli-backed funders. 
* Skydio [sent Israel](https://www.politico.eu/article/israel-drones-high-tech-weapons-united-states-ai/) 100 drones immediately after October 7th to use in their genocide in Gaza. Those drones were used to navigate and produce 3D scans of buildings in [“complex urban environments."](https://www.skydio.com/solutions/national-security/tactical-isr)

### The drone would cost a whopping $45,000 — to start.  
The money spent on police is money we could be spending to get people housed, feed residents, and improve our schools.
* Every three years, the city would need to pay $23,790 for "Licensing, Storage, Warranty and Service"[^1] which doesn't include repairs or replacement costs.
### The contract with Axon could get *even more expensive* 
* Axon has a monopoly on a lot of police tech; they are even being sued in a class-action lawsuit by the City of Augusta, Maine for their price-gouging practices. *Read*: [Second US town sues Taser-maker Axon for antitrust violations](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/second-us-town-sues-taser-maker-axon-antitrust-violations-2023-10-05/).
### The drone only has a usable life of five to seven years
That's a [lot of money](https://portlandme.portal.civicclerk.com/event/8035/files/attachment/27620) for something we'll have to replace in a few years. 
### The policy governing drones is outdated and inadequate
State-level policy is not adequate and was developed before this kind of AI-enabled surveillance technology existed.
* The State of Maine has a required reporting mechanism for police use of drones, but [this report](https://portlandme.portal.civicclerk.com/event/8035/files/attachment/27619) fails basic transparency mechanisms. 
* The public ought to know where, when, and why the police are using drones, in a quick and searchable way. That is not how Maine regulates police use of drones. Instead, the report:
	* Is a scanned *letter* that simply lists all the times law enforcement used drones in Maine. 
	* Only comes out once a year.
	* Is not searchable. 
	* Is not standardized. 
		* Some agencies get specific and write paragraphs about each deployment, and others simply have notes like "crime scene."
	* Requires no details on the location of the deployment.
	* Has no requirement for dates. Some departments put dates in their notes, most do not.
