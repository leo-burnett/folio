Here you can find talking points I've developed about the Portland Police drone. What is it and why is it bad? Read on to learn more.

## What's Happening

The Portland Police are looking for approval to buy a drone from the company Axon (see more [[source/content/Categories/Projects/Digital Justice/Portland Police Drone/Reading|reading]] on Axon here.)

> [info!] The drone purchase will most likely be on the next  City Council agenda on [**December 1, 2025**](https://portlandme.portal.civicclerk.com/event/8370/overview)

This approval comes as a growing number of police and sheriff's departments in Maine are purchasing new, AI-enabled surveillance tools. Just in the last year alone, eleven **new** agencies in Maine have started using drones. 

## What You Need to Know
- We have a right to choose what kind of technology the city is buying with our tax dollars.
- We have a right to privacy.
- **This kind of tech is new, and it's dangerous**: AI-enabled surveillance drones have only existed for a few years.
	- In places where these drones have been deployed at scale, reports show that the drones are used to surveil poor, Black, and brown neighborhoods. [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/story/the-age-of-the-drone-police-is-here/)
- **Police tech is expensive**: This drone would cost $45,316 to start. 
	- Every three years, the city would need to pay $23,790 for "Licensing, Storage, Warranty and Service" which doesn't include repairs or replacement costs.
- **Axon has a monopoly on police tech**, and they are even being sued in a class-action lawsuit by the City of Augusta, Maine for their price-gouging practices. *Read*: [Second US town sues Taser-maker Axon for antitrust violations](https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/second-us-town-sues-taser-maker-axon-antitrust-violations-2023-10-05/).
- Axon partners with a company **Skydio** to make its drones. Skydio has extensive ties to both the Israeli government and to Israeli-backed funders. *Read*: [The AI Drones Used In Gaza Now Surveilling American Cities](https://www.donotpanic.news/p/the-ai-drones-used-in-gaza-now-surveilling)
- **The City Council — and the public — have no significant oversight of how and when the drone will be used.**
	- The proposal is a **purchase order** which is accompanied by an internal police operating procedure. It is ***not*** an ordinance about how and when police can use drones and it is entirely up to the police to determine if their own procedures are being followed.
- The Trump administration is creating a massive surveillance program, aided by cooperation from tech companies. **Any data stored by Axon could get turned over to the Trump administration** to aid in its deportation agenda.
	- It doesn't matter that Portland technically "owns" its data, when it's stored in the cloud. "Cloud companies that hold and manage your data can almost always access it, which means they can be compelled to hand it over to governments." - [*Wired Magazine*](https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/)
## More details
- State-level policy is not adequate and was developed before this kind of AI-enabled surveillance technology existed.
	- The State of Maine has a required reporting mechanism for police use of drones, but this report fails basic transparency mechanisms. 
	- The public ought to know where, when, and why the police are using drones, in a quick and searchable way. This report fails basic transparency mechanisms. The report:
		- Is a scanned *letter* that simply lists all the times law enforcement used drones in Maine. 
		- Only comes out once a year.
		- Is not searchable. 
		- Is not standardized. 
			- Some agencies get specific and write paragraphs about each deployment, and others simply have notes like "crime scene."
		- Gives no details on the location of the deployment.
		- Has no requirement for dates. Some departments put dates in their notes, most do not.


We demand a broader discussion about police surveillance technology, and more protections.
