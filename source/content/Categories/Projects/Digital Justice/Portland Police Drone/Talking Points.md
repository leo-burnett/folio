Here you can find talking points I've developed about the Portland Police drone. What is it and why is it bad? Read on to learn more.

## What Is It

The Portland Police are looking for approval to buy a drone from the company Axon (see more [[source/docs/Draft/Reading|reading]] on Axon here.)

This approval comes as a growing number of police and sheriff's departments in Maine are purchasing new, AI-enabled surveillance tools. Just in the last year alone, eleven **new** agencies in Maine have started using drones.
