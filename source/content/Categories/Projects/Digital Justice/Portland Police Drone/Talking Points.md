Here you can find talking points I've developed about the Portland Police drone. What is it and why is it bad? Read on to learn more.

## What's Happening

The Portland Police are looking for approval to buy a drone from the company Axon (see more [[source/docs/Draft/Reading|reading]] on Axon here.)

This approval comes as a growing number of police and sheriff's departments in Maine are purchasing new, AI-enabled surveillance tools. Just in the last year alone, eleven **new** agencies in Maine have started using drones. 

### The basics
- Portland's drone would cost a whopping $45,316 in upfront costs. Every three years, the city would need to pay $23,790 for Licensing, Storage, Warranty and Service contract. 
	- This doesn't include repairs or replacement costs.
- Axon partners with a company **Skydio** to make its drones. Skydio has extensive ties to both the Israeli government and to Israeli-backed funders. Read: [The AI Drones Used In Gaza Now Surveilling American Cities](https://www.donotpanic.news/p/the-ai-drones-used-in-gaza-now-surveilling)
- **The City Council — and the public — have no significant oversight of how and when the drone will be used.**
	- The proposal is a **purchase order** which is accompanied by an internal police operating procedure. It is ***not*** an ordinance about how and when police can use drones and it is entirely up to the police to determine if their own procedures are being followed.
- State-level policy is not adequate and was developed prior to this kind of AI-enabled surveillance technology was developed.
	- The State of Maine has a required reporting mechanism for police use of drones, but this report fails basic transparency mechanisms. The public ought to know where, when, and why the police are using drones, in a quick and searchable way. This report fails basic transparency mechanisms:
		- The report is a scanned *letter* that simply lists all the times law enforcement used drones in Maine. 
		- The report only comes out once a year.
		- The report is not searchable. 
		- There is no standardized way for agencies to report their drone usage. Some agencies get specific and write paragraphs about each deployment, and others simply have notes like "crime scene."
		- The report gives no details on the location of the deployment.
		- The report has no requirement for dates. Some departments put dates in their notes, most do not.


This is **not**:
- A discussion about whether we want surveillance tech in our streets
- A comprehensive policy, with public oversight, on how the police can use drones
