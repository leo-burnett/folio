Welcome. I'm an writer, organizer, and activist based in Portland, Maine. 

This site is the start of a project to openly share what I'm learning, communicate about my work, and practice building and using technology that reminds us of the internet days of 'yore.

Here are some things you might want to check out while here:
- Digital Justice resource

If you're here and you want to get in touch about collaborating on trainings or other offerings, send me an email at leo@omniumcollective.com.

You might be here to check out my zine "[[Clean Your Phone Zine]]" - check it out. 

Maybe you're here because you want to work with me. If so, take a look at [[About Leo|my bio]] and my work.
