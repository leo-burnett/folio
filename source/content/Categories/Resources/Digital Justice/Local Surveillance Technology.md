Technology and the advancement of new tools like AI are being deployed in communities across the state at a breakneck speed. Very few guardrails exist to keep people safe from the ways this tech is currently being used — let alone the future implications of these tools.

  ***Just in the last year alone in Maine***: 

- Eleven *new* law enforcement agencies have started using drones[^1]. 

- Several police departments in the state are now using AI transcription software that’s described by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency) as being “intentionally designed to skirt transparency.” The software intentionally deletes drafts of AI-generated police reports, making it impossible to tell whether the final report was edited by an officer or entirely written by a large language model trained on [biased, racist data](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/11/1089683/llms-become-more-covertly-racist-with-human-intervention/).

- Towns like Sanford are [considering](https://sanfordspringvalenews.com/traffic-cameras-safety-tool-or-big-brother/) the installation of Flock cameras: the same company that gave [ICE agents](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/) access to a national database of AI-enabled cameras[^2]. Evolving evidence is also showing that some towns and police departments — namely, South Portland — already have Flock cameras installed, with little to no public input on the decision.

- School departments and town governments are using and [deploying AI](https://themainemonitor.org/ai-maine-schools/) with little scrutiny or understanding around the false promises, inaccuracies, and biases that are built into the technology that ultimately does very few of the things it claims to be capable of doing.

We need an organized and resourced coalition in the state of Maine to empower individuals and organizations across the state to be in control of the technology that's in our hands and on our streets.
