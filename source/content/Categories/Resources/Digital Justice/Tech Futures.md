### Organizing, Advocacy, and Capacity Building for the age of AI in Maine

  Technology and the advancement of new tools like AI are being deployed in communities across the state at a breakneck speed. Very few guardrails exist to keep people safe from the ways this tech is currently being used — let alone the future implications of these tools. 

  ***Just in the last year alone in Maine***: 

- Eleven *new* law enforcement agencies have started using drones[^1]. 

- Several police departments in the state are now using AI transcription software that’s described by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/07/axons-draft-one-designed-defy-transparency) as being “intentionally designed to skirt transparency.” The software intentionally deletes drafts of AI-generated police reports, making it impossible to tell whether the final report was edited by an officer or entirely written by a large language model trained on [biased, racist data](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/03/11/1089683/llms-become-more-covertly-racist-with-human-intervention/).

- Towns like Sanford are [considering](https://sanfordspringvalenews.com/traffic-cameras-safety-tool-or-big-brother/) the installation of Flock cameras: the same company that gave [ICE agents](https://www.404media.co/ice-taps-into-nationwide-ai-enabled-camera-network-data-shows/) access to a national database of AI-enabled cameras[^2]. 

- School departments and town governments are using and [deploying AI](https://themainemonitor.org/ai-maine-schools/) with little scrutiny or understanding around the false promises, inaccuracies, and biases that are built into the technology that ultimately does very few of the things it claims to be capable of doing.

We need an organized and resourced coalition in the state of Maine to empower individuals and organizations across the state to be in control of the technology that's in our hands and on our streets.

**I’m seeking to make connections with labor unions, community groups, and progressive organizing spaces to offer training, strategy, communications resources, and organizing to grow our individual and collective capacity to interrogate and limit the power of Big Tech.** 

#### Political organizing offerings include:

- Convening and facilitating a coalition of groups that are committed to holding technology — and especially tech bought and paid for by taxpayer dollars — accountable to the public interest.

- Education and awareness sessions for organizations on how to fight and win against the snake-oil sales pitches of an AI-enabled future.

- Creating and running a campaign for comprehensive data privacy

- Organizing and resources for local elected officials on how to critically regulate new surveillance tech.

- Cataloguing and keeping tabs on new proposals for surveillance and AI-enabled tech that’s being adopted throughout the state.

Do you know anyone who would like to fund this work? Are you a member of a group who would welcome a training or event around digital security, cleaning our phones, or understanding what AI actually is? Do you want to join a coalition to fight back against big tech in the state of Maine?

The synchronicity of these two events led me to create this document.
